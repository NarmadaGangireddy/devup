Abstract:
Issues with current system:
The manual fraud review process by operations has multiple steps and it takes around 6 to 10 mins to review each transaction
Need a better queue management for ops team to prioritise and work on alerts
Volumes are forecasted to grow each year and ops team is unable to complete the review for entire volume
Less visibility into the work progress and queue penetration


Solution:
Automate the manual workflow steps like to enrich, take certain actions
Automate the decision process , listing out the red flags and recommend the decision
Refer to notes generator they currently use




Details:
Identify the workflows:  Analyse and identify the current manual steps, decision points and actions involved in working a fraud case manually by ops team. Some of the activities like Customer profiling - reviewing the customer details, account and transaction history and online activity, and in some cases recipient profiling. All of these information can be prefetched and to decisions some of the activities as red flags. Actions like restrict, block profile, hold, release , letters, customer contact.
Model the BPMN workflow: work  with business to document the various workflow steps
Configure workflow execution:  orchestrate the workflow with connectors to the APIs, micro services, user tasks
Handle user tasks:
Implement Automated Activities: Automate certain activities in fraud case review like data enrichment, determine the red flags, integrate with external services for actions like customer contact/restrict/block/hold based on the outcome of the decision. These are implemented in Camunda as service tasks.
Handle Decision Making:
Monitor and Track workflow: Camunda provides a monitoring and tracking interface to monitor the execution of workflows and track the progress of individual cases. You can use the Camunda Cockpit application to visualize the workflow instances, check their status, and analyze performance metrics. Additionally, Camunda generates historical data and audit trails, allowing you to analyze the workflow's execution, identify bottlenecks, and optimize the process over time
Handle exceptions and retries: During the execution of the fraud case management workflow, exceptions or errors may occur. Camunda provides mechanisms to handle these scenarios. For example, if an error occurs during an automated activity, Camunda can retry the activity a certain number of times before raising an exception. You can configure error handling, retries, and escalation mechanisms within the workflow to ensure robustness.
